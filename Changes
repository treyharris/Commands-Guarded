Revision history for Perl extension Commands::Guarded.

1.01  Monday 03 Aug 2009
        - Corrected the github URL listed in the docs.

1.0   Monday 03 Aug 2009
        - using block no longer required.  When omitted, a step
          becomes a simple assertion
        - fixed a whitespace typo in an error message
        - Going to 1.0; this has been used for five years with no
          problems, so I think it's safe to call it production-ready!
